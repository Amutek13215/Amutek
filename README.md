These are EagleCad 7.6.0 libraries for the Arduino NANO

The V3 version WITHOUT the 0.91 OLED display is the same form as the original NANO.
The V3 versions WITH the 0.91 OLED displays have 2 different forms. 
Functionally, they are the same, however form and fit are not.
The licensed IdeaSpark V3 with 0.91 OLED display has a standard 1/10th in spacing 0.90in pin-width.
The unlicensed knock-off versions have an unusual 22mm pin-width.
Both forms have a lib with and without the 6-pin ICSP connections so you can employ either external or onboard connections.
The licensed versions will fit a typical experimenter's protoboard whereas the unlicensed knock-off versions with 22mm pin-width will not.
